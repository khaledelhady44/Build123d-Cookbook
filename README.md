# Build123d-Cookbook
A community-driven collection of build123d examples and scripts for parametric 3D modeling. Contributions welcome! ðŸš€

# Build123d Examples  

This repository is for collecting **build123d scripts** to build a dataset for training an LLM for generating CadQuery code.  

We are making this open-source so anyone can contribute useful examples and help improve the dataset. 

## What is Build123d?  

[Build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d) is a python-based, parametric, boundary representation (BREP) modeling framework for 2D and 3D CAD..   

## How to Contribute  

ðŸ”¹ **Document your code whenever possible, as we will generate requests using AI.**</br>
ðŸ”¹ **Name your script file based on the object it generates.** (e.g., gear.py, hex_nut.py, custom_bracket.py).

1. **Fork this repo**  
2. **Add your script** inside the `examples/` folder  
3. **Make sure your script runs without errors**
4. **Name the file descriptively** (e.g., cylinder_mount.py instead of script1.py).
5. **Commit and push** your changes  
6. **Open a Pull Request**  

That's it! ðŸš€  

Thank you for contributing!
